# Building an LLM AI Chat: A Complete Guide for Beginners

## Introduction
This guide will walk you through creating a Language Learning Model (LLM) server from scratch. An LLM server allows you to run AI models locally and create a chat interface similar to ChatGPT. We'll use Python and several supporting libraries to build this server.

## Prerequisites
Before starting, you should have:
- A computer running Ubuntu Linux (or similar distribution)
- Basic knowledge of Python programming
- Basic understanding of command line operations
- An NVIDIA GPU (recommended for better performance)

## What You will Build
1. A front-end Expo app (React Native and Node.js) that works on web and mobile devices (llm_chat_front_end)
2. A Node.js backend middleware server that handles routing and file management (llm_middleware_server)
3. A Python server running the Large Language Model (LLM) (llm_server_basic)

## Source Code
The source code is provided for you to freely use. Please note that to reduce the load times, the node_modules (packages) folder for each of the Node.js parts of the system are not included and will require installation as per the instructions in the webinars.
