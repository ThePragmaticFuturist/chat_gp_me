# Building an LLM Server: A Complete Guide for Beginners

## Introduction
This guide will walk you through creating a Language Learning Model (LLM) server from scratch. An LLM server allows you to run AI models locally and create a chat interface similar to ChatGPT. We'll use Python and several supporting libraries to build this server.

## Prerequisites
Before starting, you should have:
- A computer running Ubuntu Linux (or similar distribution)
- Basic knowledge of Python programming
- Basic understanding of command line operations
- An NVIDIA GPU (recommended for better performance)
